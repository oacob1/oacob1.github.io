  Hey there! On the other side of the internet is Bo Cao, a not-so-bad
  programmer, a decent husband and an awesome dad! 
  This site is my personal blog sharing anything might pop out in my
  head. It is made with Jekyll, Lanyon and hosted by Github Pages.  
</p>

In the novel, *The Strange Case of Dr. Jeykll and Mr. Hyde*, Mr. Poole is Dr. Jekyll's virtuous and loyal butler. Similarly, Poole is an upstanding and effective butler that helps you build Jekyll themes. It's made by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo).

There are currently two themes built on Poole:

* [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com)
* [Lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com)

Learn more and contribute on [GitHub](https://github.com/poole).
